# KSP-OSSP

This will be (or at least, I hope this will be) a collaborative Space Program with automated vessels if unmanned, or fly-by-wire systems for manned flights. I won't be doing career mode, as I can't find any tech tree which conforms to what I want to do with this, so this'll be done in Sandbox mode. However, I will be starting small, mostly because I don't know a lot about kOS and I want to keep a realistic progression of flights. Because all this will be open source, anyone can contribute and submit ideas for future missions, improve code for upcoming planned missions and helping plan the trajectories and procedures for upcoming missions (using KSPTOT.) Maybe, together, we can actually learn some kOS.
